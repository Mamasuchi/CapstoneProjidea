# CapstoneProjidea

-Project Idea: Website that is meant for Musicians and people that are into Music.
One of the special features my page will have is helping guitarists tune their guitar to the appropriate tuning they are
looking for(ex: Standard tuning, Half Step down Tuning, Drop D tuning).
I would also like to include lists of artists, We would have to use a database that displays lists of artists that are popular.
We would also include a database that displays lists of music that are popular currently. We would use HTML/CSS: For the basic structure of the website and JS/React to add interactivity. We would also have to use APIs such as Spotify API for lists of popular artists and current popular music. And Guitar Tuning API. Perhaps also MYSQL to store lists of artists and popular music.
